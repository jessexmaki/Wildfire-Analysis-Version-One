# Wildfire Analysis
This project aims to analyze wildfires using graph algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS). It allows users to find paths between counties affected by wildfires and measure the execution time of the algorithms.

### Introduction
Wildfires are a significant natural disaster that can cause immense damage to forests, wildlife, and human lives. Analyzing the spread of wildfires and understanding their impact is crucial for effective mitigation and response efforts.

This project utilizes a dataset containing information about wildfires in different counties. It builds an adjacency list graph to represent the connections between counties affected by wildfires. By employing graph algorithms, users can explore the relationships between counties and find paths from one county to another.

### Features
- Reads wildfire data from a CSV file
- Constructs an adjacency list graph based on county connections
- Performs Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two counties
- Performs Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore paths between two counties
- Measures the execution time of the algorithms
- Provides insights into the counties affected by wildfires and their interconnectedness
